        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p> With two available levels of difficulty, the harder one was chosen. The assignment challendged newly learned skills in pandas,
            such as .loc, group_py, counts and calculations.

        <h1>TASK</h1>
        <p>You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.
           Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.
                
           Your final report should include each of the following:
                * Total Number of Players
                * Number of Unique Items
                * Average Purchase Price
                * Total Number of Purchases
                * Total Revenue
                * Percentage and Count of Male Players
                * Percentage and Count of Female Players
                * Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed
                * Purchase Count, Average Price, Total Purchase, Average Purchase by gender
                * Purchase Count, Average Price, Total Purchase, Average Purchase by Age Group (bins)
                * Sn, Purchase Cout, Average Purchase Price, Total Pruchase of top 5 spenders 
                * Item ID, Item Name, Purchase Count, Item Price, Total Purchase Value of top 5 popular items

                As final considerations:
                * You must use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
                * You must submit a link to your Jupyter Notebook with the viewable Data Frames.
                * You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
                * See [Example Solution](HeroesOfPymoli/HeroesOfPymoli_starter.ipynb) for a reference on expected format.
